# Background Image

Please save the flowing wave gradient image (the second image you provided) as:

```
background.png
```

in this directory (`assets/images/`).

The image should be the dark background with the flowing pink/purple/blue gradient waves.

If you don't have the image file yet, I've created a programmatic version that will work as a fallback.
