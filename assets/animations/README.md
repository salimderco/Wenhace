# Lottie Animations

## How to add the signup animation:

1. Visit: https://app.lottiefiles.com/share/979e8641-b97f-4b47-89f6-13be1c63587b
2. Click the "Download" button
3. Select "Lottie JSON" format
4. Save the file as `signup_animation.json` in this folder (`assets/animations/`)
5. Uncomment the `Lottie.asset` code in `lib/screens/signup_screen.dart`

The animation will then load from the local asset instead of trying to fetch it from the network.
